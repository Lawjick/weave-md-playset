# Backstories
------------------------------
## Explaining Backstories
This is a description paragraph of what would appear when you scan a card. A card has 3 backstories. The "double hashtag" symbol at the beginning of a new line is a reserved symbol for the titles of qualities inside of a playset. The text that follows is the actual title itself. In this case, the title of this quality would be "Explaining Backstories".

### Storyteller
This paragraph of text is only visible to the storyteller at any given time.

------------------------------

## Applying Tags to a Backstory
Tags are single words that apply context to any quality. They are used by the storyteller and other qualities to identify certain effects or circumstances that would arise. Please keep tags short and to the point, preferably single words only. Advanced also reserves the STONES, GALES, FLAMES, and BROOKS tags to apply suit qualities to backstories.

## Attended school of double wand spell-fighting
You went to a very prestigious school of double wand spell-fighting. Its like spell-fighting with a regular wand, except you have TWO wands. Someone should write a book about this, and they did. That's why you went to school about it.

### Tags
- MAGICAL
- EDUCATED
- SPELL-FIGHTER

### Storyteller
The education they received while useful was only partially correct. The instructor was poorly educated in it and only used the word prestigious in the brochure to get rich families to sign up


------------------------------
# Talents
------------------------------
## Example talent
Talents are skills that a character has that could help aid them in their quest. They are different from backstories in that they have are usually used in a specific circumstance or set of circumstances. There are 4 talents for every card.

------------------------------

## Example talent (continued)
While Weave does allow for flexible rules, be careful not to add too many game mechanics to talents unless it is necessary for the feel and flavor of the talent involved.

------------------------------

## Example talent (continued)
Just like any quality, talents can have storyteller text and tags.

### Tags
- EXAMPLE
- CONTINUATION
- TAG
- LIST

### Storyteller
While not common in talents, storyteller text could still be useful. Maybe this talent comes at a cost the player may not be immediately aware of, or may require certain items to use_

------------------------------

## Rock-climbing
You are really darn good at rock climbing, or any climbing really. I mean after you scaled that big cliff, you got pretty good at climbing or scaling a lot of things. Within reason of course.

### Tags
- OUTDOORS
- ADVENTUROUS
- PHYSICAL

### Storyteller
If they try to climb something unreasonable, feel free to say no. Consider adding an additional die only if they use items that are appropriate for rock climbing.


------------------------------
# Flaws
------------------------------
## Example Flaw
Flaws are semi-generalized or specialized qualities of a character that a storyteller uses to either remove a die for a specific challenge in a given circumstance or for an enticement. There are 4 flaws for each card.

------------------------------

## Example Flaw (continued)
Try to make flaws that can be interchangeable between characters. For instance if you have another card that says "has three arms" in one card, a flaw that is titled "only one arm" in another card might create an issue if the player choose both.

------------------------------

## Example Flaw (continued)
Flaws follow the rules of qualities and although rare, flaws can use storyteller text and tags if necessary.

## Scared of Heights
You are unusually scared of heights. Maybe it was that one time you went rock-climbing, but you can't seem to shake the fear of falling if you look down from a large height.


------------------------------
# Signature Move
------------------------------
## Example Signature Move
Signature moves are usually used only once in an episode, and thus have game mechanics that are pretty powerful. Examples of powerful game mechanics could be receiving two extra dice, ignoring strikes, re-rolling strikes, re-rolling all dice, assisting all players with an extra die, etc. These can also include flavor to the story that can still affect the outcome. Bruce Banner turning into the incredible hulk would be a good example, as the size of the character would grow, which might affect certain situations in gameplay. There is only one signature move per card.


------------------------------
# Items
------------------------------
## Example Item
![Image](logo.jpg)

Items are useful in a story to characters, but don't always mean that they gain an extra die in a challenge. They also may be used to also make an action possible, which in turn may require a challenge. There are 2 items in every card.

------------------------------

## Battery-powered Flashlight
![Image](logo.jpg)

Your favorite flashlight for delving into caves, and certainly the brightest one on the market. Hopefully the batteries are still fresh...

### Tags
- BRIGHT
- SMALL
- ELECTRICAL

### Storyteller
After three uses of the flashlight or after continuous use, consider having the batteries run out


------------------------------
# NPCs
------------------------------
## Example NPC
![Image](logo.jpg)

NPC stands for non-player character, and are used by the storyteller as someone who may travel with the players or assist them briefly in the story. There are 2 NPCs in every card.

------------------------------

## Old Man Gygax
![Image](logo.jpg)

A older man with a white beard and stocky build. He seems like the type who can ramble and describe things or events at great length, and always has books with him where ever he goes

### Storyteller
Gygax will be more open to talk to players that have a *MAGICAL* tag associated with them. All others may have to perform a Brooks Challenge to keep him on topic


------------------------------
# Enemies
------------------------------
## Example Enemy
![Image](logo.jpg)

Enemies are great ways to keep players on course or challenge them during lulls in the story. They reserve the right to have non-player actions in an encounter. There are 2 enemies in a card, and typically involve one enemy being singular and the other enemy being plural in numbers.

------------------------------

## Swarm of Huge Moths
![Image](logo.jpg)

These moths are huge. Like really huge, and their razor sharp wings could perform can cut deep against any that get in their way

### Storyteller
Moths are more likely to be attracted to any player that have a BRIGHT tag associated with them.


------------------------------
# Plot Twists
------------------------------
## Example Plot Twists
These are very useful for a storyteller that may want to change up the story or reintroduce some drama into the player's lives. Plot twists are meant to change the direction of a story, or modify the outcome, but not meant to change the Theme or overarching plot of the episode. There are 2 plot twists per card.

------------------------------

## Disoriented and Lost
A magical trap was placed somewhere where your players are, and when it went off the players were disoriented by it's affects, and find themselves in another location. This may be a good time to play a location card to find out where they went, unless there is already a place in mind.


------------------------------
# Locations
------------------------------
## Example Location
![Image](logo.jpg)

Location location location. These are places that an NPC, clue, or plot point may direct the players to. Locations are usually played at the end of a scene to start up the next scene in the episode.

------------------------------

## Abandoned Hospital
![Image](logo.jpg)

The walls are ripe with moss and decay, its super creepy. There are long corridors lined with cots and medical equipment that is way past its prime. Some Fluorescent lights are still on, but flicker sporadically.

### Storyteller
If the players go too far down a hallway, they might encounter renegade punks looking to scavenge equipment, and it might incur an encounter.


------------------------------
# Theme
------------------------------
## Example Theme
The theme is the overarching plot or task of the episode and is tied to the Boss of the episode, or the Boss of the episode might benefit from a certain outcome.
